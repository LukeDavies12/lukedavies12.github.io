Motivated by (Feeds: The Only Civilised Way to Read Online (Felix Crux))[https://felixcrux.com/blog/feeds-the-only-civilised-way-to-read-online], I've started using (Reader by Readwise)[https://readwise.io/read] to help keep the noise out when I want to read about anything in software or anything else. Compared to going on social media apps or news sites, a curated feed personal to me feels a lot nicer.

Also, Reader's mobile app allows me to save any web pages to my inbox from safari, which makes collecting random articles I'll later need to organize a breeze.
